        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Harshitha Muduganti and I am a sophomore at the University of California Riverside. I am a psychology major looking to pursue a career in the psychology field. I am open to any psychology position, but I have specific expertise and training with child psychology. I am a hardworking, determined, goal oriented, and professional student and employee. I am seeking employment in a fast paced and friendly environment, where I can excel my skills and abilities and pursue a career in psychology.<br><br>

        In my past work experience, I have worked at a summer camp with children. In this position, I had to tend to children and make sure all their wants and needs were met. It was also important that I understood child development so I can take care of them with proper care. After this position had ended in the summer, I wanted to continue working with children. This is where I moved onto my current experience. My current professional experience includes working as a leader at an after school program called Kidâ€™s Factory. In this position, I am responsible for watching children after school as they wait for their parents to pick them up. I engage in activities with the children such as helping them with homework, doing crafts with them, playing board games, playing group games with them, and playing on the playground with them. This position has taught me how to be a responsible leader as I am responsible for the safety and well being of the children. I also learned how to understand and tend to children as a lot of them do not know how to control their emotions and feelings. The children tend to act out often and it has taught me how to assess and de-escalate situations, talk out their emotions, and help them through their problems. Not only am I capable of tending to children, I am also able to handle adults too. Many childrenâ€™s parents would be unhappy about certain situations and I am trained to assess situations with adults as well. I am able to calm down adults and talk out the problem with them just like I do with children. Being able to engage in tasks like this is a vital part of psychology related jobs.<br><br>

        These positions have qualified me for any psychologist positions, especially child psychologist positions, as I am well trained to understand children and their emotions. Having first hand experience with children is very vital for most psychology jobs and I believe I have exceeded qualifications for that. My current job has allowed me to practice and engage my psychology skills but I would like to further and pursue a career in psychology. I have concentrated experience in child psychology, but I am also looking to expand my knowledge and work in different fields of psychology as well. I have an outstanding work ethic and I am highly capable of working at any psychology position offered to me.
